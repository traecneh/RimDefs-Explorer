# RimDefs Explorer

A tiny, zeroâ€‘dependency web app for browsing RimWorld Defs.  

## Requirements
- Python **3.10+**
- `pip` (or `pipx`)

---

## Installation
1. Install Flask
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

---

## Copy the project files into a local folder, preserving the directory structure:
- assets/
- css/
- data/
- js/
- tools/
- index.html

---

## Usage
- Open PowerShell or Command Prompt in the same folder as index.html.
- Start the Flask server with:
  ```bash
  python tools/helper.py
  ```

## Notes
- Current version is far from complete.  I just wanted to get something up to see if it would be functional for others to use at this stage.
- I need to make the Similar Values of Tags section look cleaner.
- Add in more details from the C# assembly
- Add in tooltips for things like color / curve / etc... that will show you actual colors / curves / etc...
- And much more.  Hopefully :)
- As seen in the footer... All code generated by AI. All questionable decisions approved by a human.
